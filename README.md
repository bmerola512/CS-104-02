Sleepin' at the top, Nightmares of the Bottom.
Everybody wanna be fly 'till you swat 'em.
But who am I to talk?
I ain't ------- roses,
We in the same picture,
BUt we all got different poses.
Now I'm lookin' in my rearview,
I see the would in it.
I try to slow down,
But I get rear ended.
Pause. Like a red light, I'm dead right.
Highway to heaven, God do you see my headlights?
They say you don't know what you're doing 'till you stop doing it.
Well call me clueless 'cause I do this.
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star.
Life is a course, and imma shoot for par.
Searching for today, but instead I found tomorrow.
Well I picked that ---- back up I'll see what I find tomorrow.
Young money CMR, blood like a scar.
Weezy F baby, and the F ain't for "Flaw."
